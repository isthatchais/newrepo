## CSE 340 Project

Here I use node to build the back end of the website including things like user management, database updates, and error handling middleware.  I used VS code, pnpm, express, dotenv, and body and cookie parsers. I learned a lot and had a good experience.  This was diffult but I enjoyed learning about how to build out a back end use functionality of a database.
